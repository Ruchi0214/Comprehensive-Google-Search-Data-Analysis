# Comprehensive-Google-Search-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Google Search trends for specific keywords/topics over a defined period, identify seasonal spikes in search activity, and compare how different regions respond to the same topics. Data preprocessing, visualization, and regional interest analysis are performed to extract meaningful insights from the trends data.



Objectives
Analyze Search Trends: Fetch search interest data for specified keywords using Google Trends API and identify patterns over time.
Identify Seasonal/Periodic Spikes: Highlight recurring spikes in search activity based on the time of year.
Compare Regional Responses: Compare search interest across different geographical regions to identify regional differences.
Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize trends using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.



Tools & Libraries
Pytrends: Python interface for Google Trends.
Pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization libraries.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualizations.



Fetching Data from Google Trends
Google Trends provides data on search interest over time for specific terms. Using pytrends, data is fetched programmatically.

Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis. The data will be checked for any missing values and cleaned before moving on to analysis.

 DataFrame.fillna with 'method' is deprecated and will raise in a future version. Use obj.ffill() or obj.bfill() instead.
  trend_data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)


  
Data Visualization
Visualize the search trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns, spikes, and overall trends in search interest over time.

Regional Interest Analysis
Analyze how search interest varies across different regions, helping us understand where specific topics are most popular.
